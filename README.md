## Overview of Analysis
Use data from from the New York Citibike program to determine whether or not a similar program would work in Iowa.  Specifically, for my Tableau story, I decided to focus on male subscribers as this group makes up most of the program in New York.  
## Results
Among male subscribers, it is apparent that most bikers ride before and after working hours during the work week.  The heatmaps also show weekend activity during the late morning and early afternoon, which is most likely for leisure.  Among all users, it is known that most bike for only an hour or less reglardless of the day, which tells us that people in cities are using the bikes to go from point A to point B, or to take a short ride around the city.
### Subscriber Breakdown
![Male_Subs](/Images/story1.png "Males_Subs")  
It is clear that male subscribers make up most of the users (see 1st and 2nd slides of [Citibike Story](https://public.tableau.com/profile/joe.lapsansy#!/vizhome/Final_Citibike_Analysis_with_Story/CitibikeStory)) so Iowa should consider looking at their demographics to see if they have similar clientelle.  Early adopters in Iowa are key.  They could be female instead of male, but to make sure there is a weekday market, Iowa should consider looking at demographics of those both living and commuting inside of the city.
### Links to Heatmaps

[Heatmap2](/Images/heatmap2.png)  
[Heatmap3](/Images/heatmap3.png)  
These heatmaps show that activity is heavy before an after work, especially for male subscribers.  They show an uptick during mid-day hours during weekends.  Iowa should focus on times when transportation is needed most within Des Moines.
  
### Trip Duration

This chart shows that bikes are not used for a long amount of time meaning that they are used for a specific purpose rather than an all-day activity.

## Summary
Bikes are a good solution for commuters and travelers looking to move about the city.  New York is really congested so biking is an effective means of transportation.  For further analysis, I would look into Iowa demographics to see if they are similar to New York.  A bar chart is a good solution for this.  It would also be wise to plot people per square mile on a bubble chart or similar in order to guage the business level of the city.
