## Overview of Analysis
Use data from the New York Citibike program to determine whether or not a similar program would work in Iowa.  Specifically, for my Tableau story, I decided to focus on male subscribers as this group makes up most of the program in New York.  
## Results
Among male subscribers, it is apparent that most bikers ride before and after working hours during the work week.  The heatmaps also show weekend activity during the late morning and early afternoon, which is presumably for leisure.  Among all users and genders, it is known that most of them bike for only an hour or less regardless of the day, which tells us that people in cities use the bikes to go from point A to point B, or to take a short ride around the city.
### Subscriber Breakdown
![Male_Subs](/Images/story1.png "Males_Subs")  
It is clear that male subscribers make up most of the users (see 1st and 2nd slides of [Citibike Story](https://public.tableau.com/profile/joe.lapsansy#!/vizhome/Final_Citibike_Analysis_with_Story/CitibikeStory)).  Since early adopters in Iowa are key, Des Moines should see if they have a group of busy commuters like New York has with their male subscriber group.  Early adopters in Des Moines could be female instead of male, but to identify a potential weekday market, Iowa should look at demographics of those both living and commuting inside of the city.  From there, they can market to this group.
### Links to Heatmaps

These heatmaps show that activity is heavy before and after work, especially for male subscribers.  They also show an uptick during mid-day hours during weekends.  Iowa should focus on times when transportation is needed most within Des Moines.
  
### Trip Duration

This chart shows that bikes are not used for a long amount of time meaning that they are used for specific purposes rather than all-day activities.

## Summary
Bikes are a good solution for commuters and travelers looking to move about the city.  New York is really congested so biking is an effective means of transportation.  For further analysis, I would look into Des Moines demographics to see if they are similar to New York.  A bar chart is a good option for this.  It would also be wise to plot people per square mile on a bubble chart, map, or heat chart in order to gauge human activity within the city at different times of the day.
